## Resources

Mark works with:

RISM index of musical sources, composers etc https://opac.rism.info/main-menu-/kachelmenu with the ability to search on names and music

NEUMA, a digital library of musical scores http://neuma.huma-num.fr/home/presentation 

ABC notation database http://abcnotation.com/ 

Database of Dutch tunes http://www.liederenban.nl and http://www.liederebank.nl/mtc

Early American Secular Music and its European sources http://www.cdss.org/elibrary/Easmes/Index.htm

Mark’s work could be helped by:

Connection to other databases, so that he could automatically query a range of databases

## Remarks

Requirements for UI:
- visualize changes in musical style over time, e.g. transition from modal to tonal (evolution curves - see Weiss et al. 2018 ‘Investigating style evolution of Western classical music: A computational approach’) - with zooming
- visualize interconnections, e.g. of tunes which share melodic patterns or geographical origin.
- vizualize the circulation of certain repertoires (e.g. Italian opera).
